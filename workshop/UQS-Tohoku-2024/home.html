			<h1 class="pageTitle">Overview</h1>
			<h3 class="heading-typeB">Purpose</h3>
			<p> 
				&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
				One of the most challenging research subjects in modern physics is elucidating the nature of interacting quantum systems. 
				Strongly interacting quantum systems have been extensively studied in various fields of physics, including nuclear physics, quantum chromodynamics (QCD) of quarks and gluons, and more recently in cold atoms, where dilute atomic gases are cooled down to nano-Kelvin temperatures. 
				The theme of this program is to achieve a unified understanding of strongly correlated few- and many-body quantum systems across these fields: cold atoms, nuclear physics, and QCD.
					<br>

				&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
				To achieve this goal, we host outstanding theorists who are actively studying these broad fields. 
				By combining their knowledge and specialized methods—such as effective field theory, accurate few-body calculations, and quantum field theory—we aim to investigate the conditions under which strongly correlated few- and many-body quantum systems exhibit the same behavior and become universal. 
				This investigation particularly targets few-body Efimov physics and systems with a few impurities immersed in a many-body quantum medium. 
				Since the quantum impurity problem is also relevant for electronic transport in solids, our project will contribute to designing future high-performance quantum devices based on strongly correlated electrons.
